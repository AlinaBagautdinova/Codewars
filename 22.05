1. In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. 
   The start and the end number are both inclusive!
   
   public class Kata
{
  public static int dontGiveMeFive(int start, int end)
  {
    int count = 0;
    int a = start;
    int m = a;
    while (a != end + 1){
      if (a % 10 != 5){
        count += 1;
      }
      a += 1;
    }
    return count;
  }
}

2. Complete the function that takes an odd integer (0 < n < 1000000) which is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares, 
   and return these squares as a string in the format "bigger-smaller"
   
   public class Solution{
  public static String findSquares(int n){
    int x = (n-1)/2;
    int y = x + 1;
    int a =(int) Math.pow (x, 2);
    int b =(int) Math.pow (y, 2);
    String s = b+"-"+a;
    return s;
  }
}

3. Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "sheep", "wolf", "sheep"]
   Output: "Oi! Sheep number 1! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!"

   Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "wolf"]
   Output: "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep"
   
   public class ZywOo {

  public static String warnTheSheep(String[] array) {
    String s="";
    int num;
    for (int i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
      if (array[array.length-1] == "wolf") s = "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep";
      else if (array[i] == "wolf") {
        num = array.length-i-1;
       s= "Oi! Sheep number "+ num +"! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!";
     }
    }
    return s;
  }
}
